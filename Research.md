### COIL Report

Collaborative Online International Learning Project (COIL)
between Silesian University of Technology (Gliwice/Katowice), Wiesbaden Business School (Hochschule RheinMain) and Freiberg University of Mining and Technology from October 2023 to January 2024

During the winter semester 2023-2024, a Collaborative Online International Learning Project (COIL) between Silesian University of Technology (Gliwice/Katowice), Wiesbaden Business School (Hochschule RheinMain) and Freiberg University of Mining and Technology took place. The COIL put together about 100 students organized in 10 different groups from three universities and several different subject areas including business studies, engineering and intercultural communication. About 40 students from the module Intercultural Communication (bachelor’s degree program International Management at Wiesbaden Business School) were involved. The 10 student groups collaborated vastly independently to create business plans as well as business pitches.

The COIL aimed to achieve several learning objectives:

- first-hand experience of working together with project participants who have never met before (project-based learning)
- creating a business plan and a business pitch
- first-hand experience of intercultural and communicative factors in an international collaboration (tolerating ambiguity)
- first-hand experience of leadership including aspects as for instance self-perception and conflict resolution
- first-hand experience of conducting an entire project in English (as a lingua franca) and presenting the project in an immersive online environment
- improving literacy in digital collaboration and digital content creation
Reflective discussions at the end of the project have yielded versatile insights:
In carrying out this project, students inherently faced communicative as well as intercultural differences. While the inherent challenges in each group occasionally caused frustration, overcoming these challenges has been considered enriching. The experience of difference and diversity has offered a tremendous learning opportunity to students and the project instructors alike. From this vantage point, all students have benefited from participating in the project on multiple levels.

The project instructors Anna Smajdor, Maria Nowicka, Hubertus Weyer, Dr. Mark Jacob and Darlene Kilian met at a conference in March 2023. Multiple follow-up meetings facilitated the first implementation of the collaboration which began in early October 2023 and ended on January 12, 2024. ZoomX, padlet and instant messaging were used as platforms to collaborate synchronously and asynchronously by students and project instructors. From the inception of the project, all instructors have been aware a collaboration offers potential which a single instructor alone cannot capitalize on. The project as a whole is greater than the sum of all parts.

**Fairness and Perspective Taking in Tacit Ultimatum Bargaining: A Comparative Study of German and Chinese Negotiators**
We study the thinking processes that underlie German and Chinese negotiators’ behavior in tacit ultimatum bargaining situations in which communication is inhibited. ***Using a unique data set of transcripts from videotaped group discussions (N = 141, involving 405 students), we provide new insights based on spontaneous authentic reasoning of the bargaining protagonists.*** About one third of the groups do not refer to fairness in their arguments. For those who do, the equal split is the predominant fairness norm and the focal point of orientation in both symmetric and asymmetric settings. Addressing the equal split and combining it with fairness plays an important role for groups’ behavior, while  fairness-related arguments per se have no consistent behavioral impact. Participants address the challenge of lacking communication by reflexive thought processes. The opponent’s interests enter into the players’ deliberations in both participant pools by reasoning in two different modes of perspective taking and at higher levels. Although we observe no substantial behavioral differences between German and Chinese participants, significant
differences in underlying motives and fairness norms exist.
