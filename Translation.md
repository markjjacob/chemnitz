## Content

    {{1}}
> Each week students will discuss an issue in translation (see weekly sessions below) illustrated in sample source and target texts. They will also practise translating short texts and discuss their results with their peers. In addition, students will work through online asynchronous tasks to practise using translation software and online resources.

    {{2}}
> Students will question the significance of genre, culture, language and meaning when formulating strategies for translating and editing texts. They will also investigate specific contrasts between the German and English languages. 

## Intended Learning Outcomes

## Assessment

> Students will complete four assessments of approximately four pages (2000 words) each. The first three assessments are to be completed chronologically so that each student will have (1) translated a text, (2) written a text justifying the strategies and linguistic decisions made, and (3) received a peer evaluation of their translation. The last assessment (4) is to be completed after students have worked through the accompanying online material.

- (1) Translation (ILO 1) Weeks 4 - 6
- (2) Justification  (ILO 2) Weeks 7 - 9
- (3) Peer evaluation (ILO 3) Weeks 10 - 12
- (4) Computer-aided translation (ILO 4) Weeks 13 - 15

## Weekly Sessions Content

### Translation Experience

> **Session ILOs:**

1. **Current Location:** Students will list individually and and discuss as a group the experience they have and experiences they have had in translating. *These could range from being paid to translate a text from English to German to intralingually translating a simple instruction.*

2. **Destination and Journey:** Students will formulate where they are going and how they intend to get there.

3. **Expectations:** Students and instructor will identify their expectations of themselves, each other and the course.

#### My translating and editing experience

- Bergbaumuseum
- Pressemitteilung with students and CafeTran
- Back translations
- Medical translations
- Regulations
- Salt of the Earth

### Translation as a process and a product

> **Session ILOs:**

1. **Basic terms:** Students will define terms related to translating. *Examples include ST = source text, TT = target text*

2. **Types of Activity:**Students will recognize that the translation process can be broken down into two types of activity: understanding of the ST and formulation of the TT and that these do not necessarily occur successively.

3. **From intralingual to interlingual:** Students will describe the features that intralingual translation shares with translation proper.

4. **Degrees of Freedom:** Students will locate a TT on the degrees of freedom scale from SL to TL bias (Literal, Faithful, Balanced, Idiomizing, Free)

5. **Equivalence and Translation Loss:** Students will compare the absolutist ambition of maximizing sameness (*Equivalence*) of ST and TT with the relativist ambition of minimizing difference (*Translation Loss*)

### Cultural Issues in Translation

> **Session ILO**

1. **Cultural Transposition:** Students will differentiate between the various degrees of cultural transposition along the scale from source-culture bias to target-culture bias (Exoticism, Calque, Cultural Borrowing, Communicative Translation and Cultural Transplantation)

### Compensation

> **Session ILO:**

1. **Loss and Compensation:** Students will analyze ways in which translation loss has been compensated for.

### Textual Genre

> **Session ILO:**

1. **Genre Types:** Students will determine broad genre types (Empirical, Philosophical, Religious, Persuasive and Literary) by considering the author's attitude to the treatment of the subject matter of the text and whether the text is written or oral.

### The Function of Modal Particles

> **Session ILOs:**

### Phonic/Graphic and Prosodic Issues

> **Session ILOs:**

1. **Repetition of Sounds:** Alliteration, Assonance and Rhyme

2. **Onomatopoeia:**

3. **The Prosodic Level:** Stress, Intonation, Speed

### Grammatical and Sententiel Issues

> **Session ILOs:**

### Discourse and Intertextual Issues
