> Each week students will discuss an issue in translation (see weekly sessions below) illustrated in sample source and target texts. They will also practise translating short texts and discuss their results with their peers. In addition, students will work through online asynchronous tasks to practise using translation software and online resources (supported self-study).

    {{2}}
> Students will question the significance of genre, culture, language and meaning when formulating strategies for translating and editing texts. They will also investigate specific contrasts between the German and English languages.

## Assessment

> Students will complete four assessments of approximately four pages (500 words) each. The first three assessments are to be completed chronologically so that each student will have (1) translated a text, (2) written a text justifying the strategies and linguistic decisions made, and (3) received a peer evaluation of their translation. The last assessment (4) is to be completed after students have worked through the accompanying online material.

- (1) Translation (ILO 1) Weeks 4 - 6
- (2) Justification  (ILO 2) Weeks 7 - 9
- (3) Peer evaluation (ILO 3) Weeks 10 - 12
- (4) Computer-aided translation (ILO 4) Weeks 13 - 15

## Weekly Sessions Content

### Translation Experience

> **Session ILOs:**

1. **Current Location:** Students will list individually and and discuss as a group the experience they have and experiences they have had in translating. *These could range from being paid to translate a text from English to German to intralingually translating a simple instruction.*

2. **Destination and Journey:** Students will formulate where they are going and how they intend to get there.

3. **Expectations:** Students and instructor will identify their expectations of themselves, each other and the course.

Statistical proof of COVID-19-market hypothesis false

The well-known study by Worobey et al (2022) claims that the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the Chinese city of Wuhan is the only possible place of origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A careful analysis of the evidence has now revealed that the statistical part of the Worobey study is **blatantly wrong**. This is shown in a new carefully peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A on 16 January 2024. The authors are Professor Dietrich Stoyan from TU Bergakademie Freiberg and Professor Sung Nok Chiu from Hong Kong Baptist University.

Where did the coronavirus first emerge to infect the entire globe as a pandemic? A study by 17 authors led by Canadian scientist Michael Worobey came up with a clear answer in 2022: it was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is the only possible place of origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was published in the journal Science. And much **like the coronavirus, this thesis travelled around the world**, not only through the scientific community but also through the **mass media**. A careful analysis of the evidence has now revealed that the statistical part of the Worobey study is **blatantly false**. This is shown by a new **carefully peer-reviewed** study published on 16 January 2024 in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A.

Dietrich Stoyan from TU Bergakademie Freiberg and his Chinese colleague Sung Nok Chiu from Hong Kong Baptist University analysed the work of Worobey et al with regard to the statistical method used. Their verdict is clear: the statistics do not prove that the market in Wuhan was the early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main statistical test used is **nonsensical**, according to Stoyan, and there are other flaws in the statistical reasoning.

Stoyan and Chiu used the same geostatistical data as Worobey et al. These are the residential addresses of the first 155 coronavirus cases. These addresses were entered as points on a map. In the Science article, this dot pattern is compared with dot patterns generated by simulation and significant differences are found. However, since these artificial dot patterns are incorrectly chosen, the test used must always reject the hypothesis that a location other than the market is the epicentre. In other words: Worobey et al have excluded locations other than the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market from the outset. However, other locations in the vicinity of the market could also be possible candidates: a large railway station and a huge shopping complex with hotels and restaurants. "Worobey's study has not proven where the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic was located. Research on this question is still in its infancy," explains Stoyan.

- ... blatantly wrong -> ... the Worobey study presents major statistical flaws
- ...  much like the coronavirus, this thesis travelled around the world, not only through the scientific community but also through the mass media. -> removed
- ... is blatantly false -> ... is flawed
- ... is nonsensical -> ... is unsuitable
- ... is still in its infancy -> is still at the beginning

### Translation as a process and a product

> **Session ILOs:**

1. **Basic terms:** Students will define terms related to translating. *Examples include ST = source text, TT = target text*

2. **Types of Activity:**Students will recognize that the translation process can be broken down into two types of activity: understanding of the ST and formulation of the TT and that these do not necessarily occur successively.

3. **From intralingual to interlingual:** Students will describe the features that intralingual translation shares with translation proper.

4. **Degrees of Freedom:** Students will locate a TT on the degrees of freedom scale from SL to TL bias (Literal, Faithful, Balanced, Idiomizing, Free)

5. **Equivalence and Translation Loss:** Students will compare the absolutist ambition of maximizing sameness (*Equivalence*) of ST and TT with the relativist ambition of minimizing difference (*Translation Loss*)

### Cultural Issues in Translation

> **Session ILO**

1. **Cultural Transposition:** Students will differentiate between the various degrees of cultural transposition along the scale from source-culture bias to target-culture bias (Exoticism, Calque, Cultural Borrowing, Communicative Translation and Cultural Transplantation)

### Compensation

> **Session ILO:**

1. **Loss and Compensation:** Students will analyze ways in which translation loss has been compensated for.

### Textual Genre

> **Session ILO:**

1. **Genre Types:** Students will determine broad genre types (Empirical, Philosophical, Religious, Persuasive and Literary) by considering the author's attitude to the treatment of the subject matter of the text and whether the text is written or oral.

### The Function of Modal Particles

> **Session ILOs:**

### Phonic/Graphic and Prosodic Issues

1. **Repetition of Sounds:** Alliteration, Assonance and Rhyme
