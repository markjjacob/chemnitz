# Main

> Hallo everyone, I'm chuffed to be here! I have great memories of the last time I came to Chemnitz. No I'm not talking about Christina'S Forschungskolloquium last January, although that was a very enjoyable experience. I last came to Chemnitz on Sunday for Jugend Musiziert - my 12-year-old son played Schubert and Martinu on the violin as a duet with a promising young pianist. The weekend before I hopped on the train and went to SMAC so Chemnitz is just a stone's throw away for me especially as I live by the railway station in Freiberg.

> But back to today. What would be great to do today would be to build a world, to coconstruct a reality in which we are colleagues, working together, teaching together, researching together. In this world I would like us to feel excited: excited about the potential in TUC for the ideas I'm showing you, excited about the potential use and further development in Chemnitz of the innovative tools and technologies I'll share with you today, excited about the prospect of interacting with each other in meaningful ways. At the same time I would like us to feel safe in this world, safe in the knowledge that I am delivering high quality courses, safe in the knowledge that the students are not just satisfied but also enthusiastic and engaged, safe in the knowledge that you have another solid character in the team.

> So before we experience those feelings of excitement and safety, let's get a bit of background info on the character that you so far don't know too much about. Let's turn to the mainstream media to see what we can find out:
